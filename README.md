# Sign-up Form

This is an exercise to create a sign-up form similar to a provided [design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png). I decided to change up the design a bit and give it a spring theme.
